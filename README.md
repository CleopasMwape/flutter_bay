**Flutter Bay - Product Explorer App**
A visually appealing and responsive Flutter app to explore products from a public API.

# **Getting Started ðŸš€**

This project contains 3 flavors:

* development
* staging
* production

To run the desired flavor, use the following commands:
## Development
$ flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart

## Staging
$ flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart

## Production
$ flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart

# **Prerequisites**

Flutter SDK installed
Android/iOS emulator or physical device
API endpoint (e.g., Fake Store API or DummyJSON)

# **Setup Instructions**

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/CleopasMwape/flutter_bay
Navigate to the project directory: cd flutter_bay
Install dependencies: flutter pub get

# **State Management**

The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture with Bloc as the state management pattern. This ensures a clear separation of business logic and UI, leveraging Bloc for reactive state management and predictable state transitions.
