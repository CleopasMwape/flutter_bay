# Staging
$ flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart

# Production
$ flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart

**Prerequisites**

Flutter SDK installed
Android/iOS emulator or physical device
API endpoint (e.g., Fake Store API or DummyJSON)

**Setup Instructions**

State Management
The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture with Bloc as the state management pattern. This ensures a clear separation of business logic and UI, leveraging Bloc for reactive state management and predictable state transitions.
